        <p>I made this game because I love watching guard shows and making friends in the stands while cheering for EVERYONE. I want the game to be easy to join for as many people as possible so we can all play together.</p>
        <p>If you had fun playing bingo or have ideas of ways to improve the game to make it more fun or more inclusive and want to let me know, please use this form. It is very motivating to hear that you are having fun with the game.</p>
        <p>If you have a message that you want a response to, please feel free to send an email to <a href="mailto:jason@guardbingo.com">jason@guardbingo.com</a>. I will do my best to respond.</p>
